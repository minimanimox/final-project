            <p class="description-about">There are probably over 300 types of pasta and easily 1,200 pasta names, as so many have an Italian name and one or more regional names. Italian pasta names generally end in “ini, elli, illi, etti, ine, and elle which all denote “small”. Pastas deemed “large” end in “oni or one”. </p>

In Italy angel hair is known as capelli d’angelo. It has been eaten in Italy since the 14th Century, and is, of course, today popular worldwide. It is most commonly used with seafood and lite sauces. It also goes well in soups.

                    <td headers="conchiglie description" class="indented">You no doubt know this Italian pasta by its common name “shells”. Conchiglia is the Italian word for seashell. The shape is great for holding sauce. Shells are sometimes colored with tomato paste or spinach pigments, and is generally made from a hard variety of durum wheat which allows the pasta to retain its shell shape in all manner of cooking. Shells are also sold in a miniature version called conchigliette ideal for soup recipes.

                    <td headers="farfalle description" class="indented">Farfalle is the Italian name for bow-tie or butterfly pasta as it is the word for “butterfly”. Like so many other pastas, there is a larger version (Farfalloni) and a small version (Farfalline). Italian is a fun language. This is a North Italian pasta that was likely developed in the 1500s. Some sources say that it was accidentally invented by people making stuffed pastas. When the filling was gone they folded the leftover dough into what became the bow-tie shaped pasta we know today. Regardless of its origin, farfalle is a great pasta for most applications. Use it in casseroles, just top it with tomato sauce, or perhaps use it in pasta salads to leverage their “cute” shape. Give it a shot in this pasta with radicchio and goat cheese.

I have friends that say you can really use it in just about any recipe calling for a long noodle such as linguini. I am not a pasta purist, but they are different kinds of pasta and have different super powers. So what is the story of Fettuccine vs Linguini? Linguine came from Genoa and is a flat narrow pasta made from just flour and water. Fettuccine is flat and wide and made from eggs and flour. Linguine is typically used with lite sauces and fettuccine heavy. I love it in this Porcini Pasta!

                    <td headers="fusilli description" class="indented">Fusilli is an Italian pasta (from Campania) shaped into a corkscrew. A fuso is a “spindle”, so it is possible the name fusilli was derived from fuso. It isn’t quite as clear as some other Italian pasta names which translate directly into the pasta’s shape. Like many other pastas, a variety of colors are made and sometimes whole wheat flour is used. You can use fusilli in any recipe that calls for spaghetti with the advantage that the curls will hold sauce better than traditional spaghetti. Fusilli has several sub-variants. Fusilli Bucati is a hollow version of fusilli, and Fusilli Napoletani is made the same way, but consists of a flat noodle.

Some Italian recipes call for ricotta cheese vs egg, but whatever recipe you use we strongly recommend you make your own. There isn’t anything wrong with store bought, but it’s just fun to make your own gnocchi! The key is the balance between potato, flour, and egg. If you want to try a heretical, at least to pasta purists, but healthier version of gnocchi, give this Sweet Potato Gnocchi a try.

The large, flat sheet noodles, for example, can be flat or with curly edges. In Northern Italy they are generally made with eggs, but in the south they are not. Here at LiveEatLearn we like to know our food history, and lasagna has history.
                        We believe that some form of lasagna was created by the ancient Greeks and brought to Rome after Greece was conquered by the Romans in the 2nd century BC. The Romans conquered everybody in time. It came to America in the 1800s with a large wave of Italian immigrants.

Penne is the ubiquitous tube-shaped pasta with ridges that is used in so much American cooking. Unlike so many pastas, penne pasta is a relative newcomer to Italian cuisine having been invented in Genoa in 1865. Penne’s hollow shape and ridges hold thick sauces well, so despite its larger size it goes well in recipes like this Truffle Macaroni and Cheese, Baked Ziti, or One Pot Pasta!

It is usually made with an egg and flour pasta. The cut squares of pasta are filled with meats, vegetables, or ricotta cheese then sealed. We assert that ravioli is best served in a light tomato sauce so that the sauce does not take center stage over the fillings. Ravioli likely appeared in Italy in the 14th Century, and has been popular since. In Italy the family making of ravioli is arguably as important as eating it as a family.

Rotini is great in pasta salads, and can often be found in spinach infused green or tomato infused red color.

The traditional Italian way to eat Tagliatelle is to eat it fresh (rolled and cut by hand) with meat sauce. If you don’t want to make your own fresh pasta, you can certainly buy it dry in either the traditional yellow color or green containing spinach. Give it a try in this Porcini Pasta.

Classic American baked ziti is made from some combination of parmesan, ricotta, vegetables, various meat options, and of course a meaty tomato paste. In Sicily it is considered a wedding dish. In fact ziti is the plural of zito which means “bride” or “groom”.
